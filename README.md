# User Management Package

This open-source package allows you to create users on your Linux server with ease. It is designed for simplicity and compatibility with most Linux distributions.

**Note**: Currently, this package supports only Ubuntu (x86_64).
## Future Enhancements

I am actively working on adding more features to enhance functionality and usability.
